The code provided shows two functions in a Laravel project that relate to job management. Here are my thoughts on the code:

jobEnd() function:
The function seems to be doing a lot of things, which is not good for code maintainability and readability. It should be broken down into smaller, more focused functions.
The function is also performing multiple operations on the $job object, which could be refactored to reduce duplicate code.
There is also some code duplication in the email sending functionality that could be refactored into a separate function.
The naming of variables and functions could be improved for better readability.
The use of Event::fire() is deprecated in Laravel, and it should be replaced with event().

getPotentialJobIdsWithUserId() function:
The function has a descriptive name, which is good for readability.
The code has some conditional statements that could be improved using a switch statement for better readability.
The function could benefit from some comments to explain its functionality.
The function has some database queries that could be refactored for better performance.
Overall, the code seems to be ok, but it could be improved in terms of structure, readability, and maintainability. Here are some suggestions on how to improve the code:

jobEnd() function:
Break down the function into smaller, more focused functions.
Refactor the code that performs operations on the $job object to reduce duplicate code.
Refactor the code that sends emails into a separate function to reduce duplication.
Use more descriptive names for variables and functions.
Replace Event::fire() with event().

getPotentialJobIdsWithUserId() function:
Use a switch statement instead of multiple if-else statements.
Add comments to the function to explain its functionality.
Refactor database queries for better performance.
